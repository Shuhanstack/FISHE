### SOP for Data Management

This document describes 1) the file structure of the repository; 2) example workflow; and 3) recommended naming conventions. 

#### File Structure

The file of structure of this repository mimics the workflow used to move from data generation to final figures. A description of the files in each folder is as follows:

- `01_model_scripts/`: folder containing the models developed to generate data used in the analysis
  - *model*`.R`: R script for each *model* 
- `02_run_models/`: parent folder for different model runs 
  - `README.md`: Contains information on the purpose and assumptions for the model runs. *README*s can be generated using the template found here
  - *model*`.rmd`: Markdown document to source and run the *model*
- `03_model_output/`: folder containing the cvs output from the `02_run_models` folder
  - *model_run*`.csv` : csv file of the output for each *model run*
- `04_process_data_code/`: folder containing code for processing model run outputs
  - *model_run*`.rmd`: markdown containing the code to process the *model run* output into data to use in the analysis
    - Note: csv files generated by the models are generally too large to host on GitHub and have to be broken down into different assessment years or climate change intervals. The different datasets are then filtered down and joined into one data set during the processing code stage.  
- `05_analysis_data/`: folder for analysis data generated by the processing code contained in the `04_process_data_code` folder
  - *model_run_analysis*`.csv`: file of data for each *model run* to use in the analysis code; csv format
- `06_analysis_code/`: folder containing code to analyze data 
  - *analysis*`.rmd`: Rmarkdown file to run an *analysis* and generate any tables or figures
- 07_figures/ : folder containing figures generated through code in the `06_analysis_code` folder
  - *figure*`.png`: png image output for each *figure*
