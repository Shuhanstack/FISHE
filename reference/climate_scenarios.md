### Climate Scenarios

The following table of climate scenarios is a duplicate of *Table 3* in the projects [final report](http://bren.ucsb.edu/research/documents/SomefinFISHEFinalReport.pdf). The following excerpt from the report explains what is being shown in the table.

"The model's `r_s` value is a compounding annual rate of change in productivity. The lower bound (30% decline) and the upper bound (33% increase) of productivity change per degree (°C) of sea surface temperature change were gathered from [Free *et al* 2019](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6430/979.abstract). The pace of climate change (°C/year) was taken from two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and scaled to match the length of the simulation (100 years). Under RCP 4.5, a single degree of temperature change occurs over 33 years [Hoegh-Guldberg *et al* 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WGIIAR5-Chap30_FINAL.pdf), and there would be an approximately 3°C change over 100 years. For RCP 8.5, one degree of warming occurs every 20 years [Hoegh-Guldberg *et al* 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WGIIAR5-Chap30_FINAL.pdf) for a total of 5°C over 100 years."
